## The History and Purpose of *Hello, World!*

The *Hello, World!* program is a simple computer program that displays the message “Hello, World!” on the screen. It is traditionally used as the first example when learning a new programming language because of its simplicity and clarity. This program helps learners verify that their development environment is correctly installed and that they understand the basic process of writing and running code.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The tradition of using *Hello, World!* as an introductory program became widely recognized after it appeared in the 1978 book *The C Programming Language*, written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. In this influential text, the authors used the program to demonstrate basic syntax and input/output functions in the C programming language. Although similar examples existed earlier, this publication played a crucial role in popularizing the phrase and establishing it as a standard first step in programming education.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Today, *Hello, World!* remains a symbolic and practical starting point for programmers around the world. Whether in beginner tutorials, academic courses, or technical documentation, it continues to represent the entry point into the world of coding.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
